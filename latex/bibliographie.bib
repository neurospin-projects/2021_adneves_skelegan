	abstract = {We propose a new framework for estimating generative models via an adversarial process, in which we simultaneously train two models: a generative model G that captures the data distribution, and a discriminative model D that estimates the probability that a sample came from the training data rather than G. The training procedure for G is to maximize the probability of D making a mistake. This framework corresponds to a minimax two-player game. In the space of arbitrary functions G and D, a unique solution exists, with G recovering the training data distribution and D equal to 1/2 everywhere. In the case where G and D are defined by multilayer perceptrons, the entire system can be trained with backpropagation. There is no need for any Markov chains or unrolled approximate inference networks during either training or generation of samples. Experiments demonstrate the potential of the framework through qualitative and quantitative evaluation of the generated samples.},

	abstract = {In recent years, supervised learning with convolutional networks ({CNNs}) has seen huge adoption in computer vision applications. Comparatively, unsupervised learning with {CNNs} has received less attention. In this work we hope to help bridge the gap between the success of {CNNs} for supervised learning and unsupervised learning. We introduce a class of {CNNs} called deep convolutional generative adversarial networks ({DCGANs}), that have certain architectural constraints, and demonstrate that they are a strong candidate for unsupervised learning. Training on various image datasets, we show convincing evidence that our deep convolutional adversarial pair learns a hierarchy of representations from object parts to scenes in both the generator and discriminator. Additionally, we use the learned features for novel tasks - demonstrating their applicability as general image representations.},

This makes it possible to apply the same generic approach to problems that traditionally would require very different loss formulations. We demonstrate that this approach is effective at synthesizing photos from label maps, reconstructing objects from edge maps, and colorizing images, among other tasks. Indeed, since the release of the pix2pix software associated with this paper, a large number of internet users (many of them artists) have posted their own experiments with our system, further demonstrating its wide applicability and ease of adoption without the need for parameter tweaking. As a community, we no longer hand-engineer our mapping functions, and this work suggests we can achieve reasonable results without hand-engineering our loss functions either.},

To address this limitation, we propose {StarGAN}, a novel and scalable approach that can perform image-to-image translations for multiple domains using only a single model. Such a unified model architecture of {StarGAN} allows simultaneous training of multiple datasets with different domains within a single network. This leads to {StarGAN}'s superior quality of translated images compared to existing models as well as the novel capability of flexibly translating an input image to any desired target domain. We empirically demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on a facial attribute transfer and a facial expression synthesis tasks.},

	abstract = {Convolutional Neural Networks ({CNNs}) have been recently employed to solve problems from both the computer vision and medical image analysis fields. Despite their popularity, most approaches are only able to process 2D images while most medical data used in clinical practice consists of 3D volumes. In this work we propose an approach to 3D image segmentation based on a volumetric, fully convolutional, neural network. Our {CNN} is trained end-to-end on {MRI} volumes depicting prostate, and learns to predict segmentation for the whole volume at once. We introduce a novel objective function, that we optimise during training, based on Dice coefficient. In this way we can deal with situations where there is a strong imbalance between the number of foreground and background voxels. To cope with the limited number of annotated volumes available for training, we augment the data applying random non-linear transformations and histogram matching. We show in our experimental evaluation that our approach achieves good performances on challenging test data while requiring only a fraction of the processing time needed by other previous methods.},

Models are typically based on large amounts of data with annotated examples of known markers aiming at automating detection. High annotation effort and the limitation to a vocabulary of known markers limit the power of such approaches. Here, we perform unsupervised learning to identify anomalies in imaging data as candidates for markers. We propose {AnoGAN}, a deep convolutional generative adversarial network to learn a manifold of normal anatomical variability, accompanying a novel anomaly scoring scheme based on the mapping from image space to a latent space. Applied to new data, the model labels anomalies, and scores image patches indicating their fit into the learned distribution. Results on optical coherence tomography images of the retina demonstrate that the approach correctly identifies anomalous images, such as images containing retinal fluid or hyperreflective foci.},

In addition to the image synthesis, we investigate the controllability and interpretability of the 3D-{StyleGAN} via style vectors inherited form the original {StyleGAN}2 that are highly suitable for medical applications: (i) the latent space projection and reconstruction of unseen real images, and (ii) style mixing. We demonstrate the 3D-{StyleGAN}'s performance and feasibility with {\textasciitilde}12,000 three-dimensional full brain {MR} T1 images, although it can be applied to any 3D volumetric images. Furthermore, we explore different configurations of hyperparameters to investigate potential improvement of the image synthesis with larger networks.

It can learn a joint distribution with just samples drawn from the marginal distributions. This is achieved by enforcing a weight-sharing constraint that limits the network capacity and favors a joint distribution solution over a product of marginal distributions one. We apply {CoGAN} to several joint distribution learning tasks, including learning a joint distribution of color and depth images, and learning a joint distribution of face images with different attributes.

	abstract = {The practical realization of end-to-end training of communication systems is fundamentally limited by its accessibility of the channel gradient. To overcome this major burden, the idea of generative adversarial networks ({GANs}) that learn to mimic the actual channel behavior has been recently proposed in the literature. Contrarily to handcrafted classical channel modeling, which can never fully capture the real world, {GANs} promise, in principle, the ability to learn any physical impairment, enabled by the data-driven learning algorithm. In this work, we verify the concept of {GAN}-based autoencoder training in actual over-the-air ({OTA}) measurements. To improve training stability, we first extend the concept to conditional Wasserstein {GANs} and embed it into a state-of-the-art autoencoder-architecture, including bitwise estimates and an outer channel code. Further, in the same framework, we compare the existing three different training approaches: model-based pre-training with receiver finetuning, reinforcement learning ({RL}) and {GAN}-based channel modeling. For this, we show advantages and limitations of {GAN}-based end-to-end training. In particular, for non-linear effects, it turns out that learning the whole exploration space becomes prohibitively complex. Finally, we show that the training strategy benefits from a simpler (training) data acquisition when compared to {RL}-based training, which requires continuous transmitter weight updates. This becomes an important practical bottleneck due to limited bandwidth and latency between transmitter and training algorithm that may even operate at physically different locations.},

The recently proposed Wasserstein {GAN} ({WGAN}) makes progress toward stable training of {GANs}, but sometimes can still generate only low-quality samples or fail to converge. We find that these problems are often due to the use of weight clipping in {WGAN} to enforce a Lipschitz constraint on the critic, which can lead to undesired behavior. We propose an alternative to clipping weights: penalize the norm of gradient of the critic with respect to its input. Our proposed method performs better than standard {WGAN} and enables stable training of a wide variety of {GAN} architectures with almost no hyperparameter tuning, including 101-layer {ResNets} and language models over discrete data.

	abstract = {Obtaining expert labels in clinical imaging is difficult since exhaustive annotation is time-consuming. Furthermore, not all possibly relevant markers may be known and sufficiently well described a priori to even guide annotation. While supervised learning yields good results if expert labeled training data is available, the visual variability, and thus the vocabulary of findings, we can detect and exploit, is limited to the annotated lesions. Here, we present fast {AnoGAN} (f-{AnoGAN}), a generative adversarial network ({GAN}) based unsupervised learning approach capable of identifying anomalous images and image segments, that can serve as imaging biomarker candidates. We build a generative model of healthy training data, and propose and evaluate a fast mapping technique of new data to the {GAN}'s latent space. The mapping is based on a trained encoder, and anomalies are detected via a combined anomaly score based on the building blocks of the trained model - comprising a discriminator feature residual error and an image reconstruction error. In the experiments on optical coherence tomography data, we compare the proposed method with alternative approaches, and provide comprehensive empirical evidence that f-{AnoGAN} outperforms alternative approaches and yields high anomaly detection accuracy. In addition, a visual Turing test with two retina experts showed that the generated images are indistinguishable from real normal retinal {OCT} images. The f-{AnoGAN} code is available at https://github.com/{tSchlegl}/f-{AnoGAN}.},
